# Assignment 2
## Edward Scheff

My website is the start of a site that's all about consulting services I can offer. I'm in the MSSD program but still really enjoy solving business analytics and supply chain problems, so want to do some consulting in that domain as a side business.

### How to Open the Website
- Unzip the folder
- Intended starting page is 'index.html', though it is possible to open any of the .html files and navigate to any of the other pages
- Right-click on the file in your file browser, click 'Open With', and select the browser you woud like to use to open
- Enjoy the site!

### Changes Since Last Week
- CSS styling
- Added a new page (Sample)
- Broke up paragraphs of text so mobile views aren't unbroken walls of words
- Minor rephrasings + additions to verbiage
- Cleaned up classes as my design came together

### Things to Note
- HTML and CSS both validated before submitting with no additional changes to either after validation
- I really struggle with creating good aesthetic designs. I know this isn't a masterpiece by any means, but I have spent 25-30 hours and am really proud of what I've been able to put together
- The Contact page is intentionally light on content, and it follows that Semantic HTML elements are fewer. 
     - This is to reduce the workload on the user. By visiting this page, a user has already indicated interest in contacting me about my services. 
     - I don't want them to sort through even more content before being able to contact me (currently a link to my email, maybe a form in a future week), so by keeping the page to the bare minimum, I'm keeping the funnel wide
- Ideas for future weeks
     - Make a form on the contact page?
     - Convert the 'Contact' option on the nav and throughout page content to be buttons?
     - Instead of a static safety stock example on sample page, use forms and JavaScript to allow user to enter their own inputs and return the calculation?
     - Project examples on 'Projects' page collapsible boxes + reorganization?

### How I Went Above and Beyond
- Maintained last week's above + beyond
- Exceeded the requirement of each element having at least one style impacting it; most have several
- Exceeded the 3-layout requirement:
    - Screen width <= 640px
    - Screen width 640 to 900px
    - Screen width >= 900px
    - Print layout
- For each screen width layout, I adjusted many things to create a distinct look for each dimension:
    - nav padding
    - figure width + whether or not to display
    - swapping a table for a list on mobile widths
    - underlines on headings in mobile view for some visual differences
    - padding around main
    - font size of various elements:
        - h1
        - h2
        - h3
        - nav text
    - visiblity of iframe (YouTube video)
- For print layout, I adjusted several things to create a look for printing
    - margins
    - colored section backgrounds
    - I tried to strip out things that wouldn't make sense on a printed page, as the use case for printing is more informative:
        - nav
        - iframe (youtube video)
        - calls to action ("Contact me now!")
