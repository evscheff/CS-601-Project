        <p>I get it. As a small business owner, you want to know who you're trusting with your business, so here's the
            skinny on me.</p>


        <!-- Ed's background in supply chain -->
        <section id="MyBackground" class="GreyBlock">
            <h2>Origin Story</h2>
            <p>My undergrad background at Georgia Tech was in operations & supply chain management. I've worked since
                in various parts of the supply chain, ranging from purchasing to warehousing to demand planning.</p>
            <p>Along
                the
                way,
                I realized that I really love data, building tools, and databases. So now I'm working on finishing up a
                Masters
                program in Software Development at Boston University.</p>

            <h2>Not <i>Just</i> a Data Nerd</h2>
            <p>
                Yes, I'm a self-admitted data nut. But I'm so much more than that. I'm also a dyed-in-the-wool
                stereotypical
                outdoorsy Coloradoan, I'm a
                passionate hiker, kayaker, and dabble in climbing. </p>
            <p>When you reach out about <a href="contact.html">how I
                    can
                    help you</a>, be sure to ask me about my favorite craft brewery, Subaru model, and REI
                location. I
                also
                have
                to keep my pup supplied with a perpetual supply of chew toys and biscuits.
