            <h2>This Isn't What You Had Imagined</h2>
            <p>
                You didn't start your business to spend your valuable time worrying about every little kink in the
                global supply
                chain, yet here you are. 2021 has slapped you with a cold, hard reality check.</p>
            <p>Now instead of
                growing
                your business, you're struggling just to keep up. </p>
            <p>Canal Obstructions. Semiconductor Shortages. Port Backlogs.
                The list goes on and to be frank, there's likely even more volitility on the horizon.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a small fish in this huge torrent of supply chain disruption, it can be intimidating. Where do you
                even
                start?

                It Doesn't Have to be This Way

            <p>
                Don't get me wrong. There's no magic button and stabilizing the ship won't happen overnight. But there
                are
                simple steps you can take to restore a sense of calm. Unfortuantely as a small
                business, you don't need multi-million dollar software implementations. </p>
            <p>And the McKinsey and Deloitte
                consultants of the world aren't going to give you the time of day
                (besides,
                their shortsighted, one-size-fits-all solution of [pick-out-of-a-hat]% "workforce reductions" are
                irrelevant to your needs
                anyway).</p>

            <p>But I will. I've been there and seen the difference
                firsthand. Throughout my career, I've combined cutting edge data & analytics with a solid understanding
                of
                business needs to
                drive improvements in supply chain management. </p>

            <h2>How Can I Help You?</h2>
            <p>Through my powerful combination of experience with business process analysis, analytics & data knowledge,
                and
                ability to build tools, there's really no limit to how I can help your bottom line. </p>
            <p>While my background
                is
                in supply chain and demand planning, many of the same pricinciples and tools can be slightly modified to
                help with activities ranging from product management to digital advertising.</p>
            <p>
                But also, I understand I'm not the smartest person in the room and that I can learn as much
                from you as you can from me, if not more. My philosiphy is to listen first and to truly understand your
                business. </p>
            <p>I won't march in with a laundry list of predetermined steps and force
                you into a standard box used many times before. Instead, I promise to listen first and foremost. </p>
            <p>That's
                because
                I know that every business is different and taking the time to create a targeted solution to your unique
                situation is important.
