            <h2>Historic Data Reporting System</h2>

            <h3 class="par">Problem</h3>
            <p>
                One organization did not have any consolidated historic reporting relating to key business processes:
                orders, sales, and shipments. Each lived in a different system, each system being managed by a various
                contract 3rd party service
                provider.
            </p>
            <p>Each query that involved comparisons between the different processes caused hours of overhead
                while employees had to submit report requests into various systems and wait for the data to generate.
            </p>
            <p>Each
                provider had different categorization and data retention practices, so after report generation employes
                had
                to spend even
                more time manually tying everything together, and sometimes couldn't even obtain the historic data they
                required. </p>
            <h3 class="par">Approach</h3>
            <p>
                To tie everything together, first I had the need to create consistent product and customer hierarchies.
                Then, I had to extract the transaction data, extract & normalize, and load into our own solution.
                Employees
                were then able to maintain the new system on an ongoing basis and add new data as available.
            </p>
            <h3 class="par">Result</h3>
            <p>
                The query process improved from an hour(s)-long effort into a second(s)-long effort, freeing up
                employees to
                spend time on more productive tasks. In addition, having consolidated dimensional hierarchies allowed us
                to
                add more business processes into reporting scope at later dates:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>current inventory</li>
                <li>historic inventory</li>
                <li>order detail</li>
                <li>demand plan</li>
                <li>production history</li>
                <li>budget</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Second project is the MRP tracking system -->
        <section id="MrpSystem" class="BlueBlock">
            <h2>An Inventory Tracking System</h2>
            <h3 class="par">Problem</h3>
            <p>One consumer packaged goods company tracked hundreds of individual SKUs in individual SKU-specific Excel
                files.
                Employees spent thousands of hours annually updating individual files and no consolidation existed to do
                any
                ad-hoc reporting on
                expected production needs.
            </p>

            <p>Any time a new customer launched, existing customer left, or any product changes
                happened, employees would have to update dozens of files and provide manual summaries.
            </p>

            <h3 class="par">Approach</h3>
            <p>
                The project involved creating a consolidated system using Materials Resource Planning (MRP) logic, so
                that
                one plan could exist in one place.
            </p>
            <p>
                The employees intended to use this tool were not database users, so we chose to use
                Microsoft Power BI as a self-service BI solution to bridge the gap between the use cases of Microsoft
                Excel
                and
                a true database system.
            </p>
            <h3 class="par">Result</h3>
            <p>
                I created a consolidated system using information from these sources and applied Materials Resource
                Planning
                logic to create reorder and transfer recommendations. We went from having hundreds of files to analyze
                and
                report, to having one input per business process (current inventory, demand plan, outstanding
                production,
                etc.)
                and one tool for reporting.
            </p>

            <p>
                For reporting, we went from each SKU-level file being its own report to having one consolidated
                reporting
                source that fed into two outputs: a dashboard and an OLAP report that Excel could connect to via a
                traditional PivotTable.

        <!-- final project is a safety stock system -->
        <section id="SafetyStockSystem" class="GreyBlock">
            <h2>Statistical Safety Stock Calculator</h2>
            <h3 class="par">Problem</h3>
            <p>
                Another project dealt with the frequent occurrence of stockouts. The company in question held some level
                of
                safety stock, but the levels were decided based on feelings and a "finger in the wind" method.
            </p>

            <p>With variability in both demand and leadtimes that could not be consistently forecasted, the status quo
                was
                not working. </p>
            <p>The
                company faced high stockout costs but the inventory had a short shelf-life and products were frequently
                replaced with newer versions. Because of these factors, we needed to optimize
                considering the risks of both stocking out and excess inventory.</p>
            <h3 class="par">Approach</h3>
            <p>I worked with multiple teams to build a pipeline to capture and calculate profiles of
                production leadtime and customer demand,
                as well as the costs implicated with understocking and overstocking. </p>
            <h3 class="par">Result</h3>
            <p>After building this tool we were
                ultimately able to set a responsive stocking strategy, decreasing stockouts by 70% without
                leading to increased scrap costs from overages.
