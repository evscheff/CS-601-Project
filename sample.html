            <h1>Safety Stock Sample</h1>
            <p>
                Sure you've seen my project samples, but you want to see a little more. I can't blame you! Here's a
                taste of what I can help bring to the table.</p>

                <h2>Sample Inputs</h2>
                <p>In this example, I'll show what a safety stock might look
                    like for one product in a local retailer. You'll see the inputs and the output, then I'll discuss
                    other
                    considerations to keep in mind.

                <h2>Sample Results</h2>
                <p>Let's also assume that your desired service level is 85%. How much safety stock do you need to
                    maintain
                    to ensure you fulfill 85% of all of your customers' orders? Drumroll, please!</p>
                <p>Assuming demand and leadtimes stay near current levels, a safety stock of 117 units
                    should be
                    maintained
                    to achieve an 85% service level. What does this mean? On top of the 500 units you expect to sell,
                    you should make sure you have another 117 on hand to account for extreme scenarios.
                    <br><br>According to
                    this
                    calculation, with this level of safety stock you
                    should only see a combination of
                    high demand and/or long leadtimes to such a high level that demand exceeds supply in 15% of cases
                    (roughly 55 days of the year).

                <h2>Hold on a Minute</h2>
                <p><b>You (probably):</b> <br>OK, that's great. But how do I select a service level? 85% seems kind of
                    low.
                    How
                    should I handle situations where my demand and/or leadtimes are increasing or decreasing? What if I
                    don't even have this data?</p>

                <p><b>Me:</b><br> Great questions! Applying the formula is the easy part. As for the rest, there's no
                    one-size answer, and it's as much an art as it is a science.
                    The hard part is in understanding your unique situation: capturing and cleaning the data;
                    understanding
                    the economics and cost structure of your inventory (is it perishable? what's the economic cost of a
                    lost sale versus scrapping inventory?); and that
                    takes experience & judgement.
